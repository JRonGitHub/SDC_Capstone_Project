This model is trained on a relatively small but very balanced, (handpicked) dataset from mainly 3 different datasets:

LARA dataset from trafficlights in France
Bosch dataset from trafficlights in California
Udacity Simulator and Lot datasets

Each has more or less a third of the training data here, the lot dataset was artificially inflated, by flipping images (and labels of course as well)

The graph works pretty good on the test video in the Capstone Object Detection Workspace, even captures traffic light before I consciously saw it at the right spot. However it also sees a few traffic lights that aren't there (not a lot, but it happened).
